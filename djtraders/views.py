"""
View functions for the djtraders app.

  1. customer_list/product_list are ORM-based list views (Customer.objects/
    Product.objects), each with a search form whose GET parameters are
    handed to the model's own search() classmethod rather than building
    the filter here.
  2. customer_detail looks up one Customer, lists their orders
    (customer.order_set), and totals quantity/revenue across them.
  3. order_detail illustrates model traversal end to end: forward FKs
    to Customer/Employee/Shipper, a reverse relation to its line items,
    each reaching its own Product.
  4. product_detail is left as an assignment component -- students build
    that view (and its template/URL) themselves.
  5. customer_detail/order_detail read order.order_total/line.line_total
    (plain Python properties on the models) directly, instead of
    building the same math with ExpressionWrapper/F/Sum queryset
    annotations here.
