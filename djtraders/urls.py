"""
URL configuration for the djtraders app.

Each Django *app* gets its own urls.py so its routes stay self-contained;
the project-level urls.py (DjangoTraders/urls.py) "includes" this file
under a prefix.

  1. Added product_list_url
        Same shape as customer_list_url, routing to views.product_list.

  2. Added customer_detail_url
        Captures the row's primary key in the URL path (e.g.
        /djtraders/customers/ALFKI/) and passes it to the matching view.

  3. Added order_detail_url
        Same shape, routing /djtraders/orders/<order_id>/ to
        views.order_detail with an <int:...> converter.

  4. Removed product_detail_url
        product_detail (view, template, and this route) is left as an
        assignment component -- students build it themselves.
